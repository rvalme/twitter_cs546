# twitter_cs546

This application has two main features that we think would be favorable for Twitter.
The first is being able to filter your newsfeed by some topic or keyword. The second is
being able to print hobbyists of various topics.

## Running
In order to run our prototype twitter run the below:
`python twitter.py`

The below contains the instructions for using out prototype Twitter
    1. pn - Print News Feed
    2. fn topic - Filter NewsFeed
    3. e End Session
    4. ph - Print Hobbyists
    
    
To run these apps, you must have python 2.7 installed

To use the app, first load the terminal if using Linux or the command prompt if using Windows
Then navigate the directory/folder where you are storing the running files

To load the Find Tweets app, run “python2 twitter.py”

You will then encounter a prompt where you are given the following: 

“pn - Print News Feed, fn - Filter News Feed, - End Session”

If you want to print all the news feed, type “pn”, if you want to filter the news feed type, for example music, type “music fn”, if you want to end the session type “e”.
